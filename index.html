            <p>Hello, my name is Evan Hurley. I am a native from Colorado who grew up in Kansas. I hold two Bachelor's Degrees from the University of Kansas (BS in Account and BS in Information Technology Systems). Currently I work as a DevOps Engineer focussing in process automation, FinTech support, and ServiceNow development.</p>
            <p>Outside of work my primary hobbies are following European Football Leagues and learning as much as possible. I wouldnâ€™t say I have a favorite club yet as to me any soccer is good soccer. Languages have always been a passion of mine and I am currently studying to become fluent in German (and possibly Swedish).</p>
            <p>Combining my interest in languages and in tech I have begun pursuing computer science. I taught myself a basic to intermediate amount of Visual Basic, SQL, and R to start. Now that I have discovered just how much I enjoy this basic amount of programming, I am pursuing a web development program from the University of Denver and Python from Microsoft / MIT.</p>
